Steps: 

1. The approach is similar to the implementation of Trie 

Time and Space complexity: 

insert method: 
Space complexity:O(N) 
Time complexity: O(N) whereas N is the number of characters in the input word

find method: 
Space complexity:O(1) 
Time complexity: O(N)

suffixes method: 

Space complexity: O(M*N): M being all suffixes and N for storing the longest suffixes. This is being for each stack frame.
Time complexity: O(M*N): M being all suffixes and N for storing the longest suffixes.
