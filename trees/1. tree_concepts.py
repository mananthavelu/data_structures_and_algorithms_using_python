# Tree Concepts

# Trees are non-linear data structure
# Tree has a 'root' 
# The access to the Tree is using 'root' 
# Tree must be connected
# Tree must not have cycles
# Terms: 
# Level: 'root' is at level 1 and the 'node' connected to it is at level 2 (Starts from top-> reaching bottom)
# Ancestor/Descendant ; Parent/Child
# Leaf: The nodes which dont have any child are leaf nodes or external nodes
# Leaf: The nodes which have the children are 'internal nodes'
# Height: The number of edges connecting two nodes from its bottom (starting at 0)
# Height: Height of the tree = Height of the root node
# Depth: Depth of the node is the total number of edges to its root
# Height and Depth moves inveresely
