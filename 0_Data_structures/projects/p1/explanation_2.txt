Algorithm/Technique used: Recursion is used given the fact that the depth of the folder structure may be a large to either traverse.
Recursion helps us to backtrack to the previous stages (Parent Directory for each file/folder) by recalling the same function.

Time complexity:
O(n*m): 
This is because;
a. In a folder, there may be in total 'n' number of files and sub-folder
b. Individidual sub-folder may contain its own number of items which may be 'n'  or ' more than n' i.e m

COnsidering that 'm'  is constant; this can be simplified as O(n)

Space complexity:O(n)
Total number of files with .c which is at the worst case; all files contain .c extension
