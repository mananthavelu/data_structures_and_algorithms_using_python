Steps taken:

1. Check by element in an input list if it is largest integer in the list between 9 to 1
2. Append it to the larger or smaller intermediate list
3. Return the final intermediate lists as integers

Time complexity:

O(N) : 

Time complexity for outer loop: O(1)
Time complexity for inner loop: O(n)

Space complexity:

O(N): The total number of elements can stored and returned as a result is N in total which is the length of the input
