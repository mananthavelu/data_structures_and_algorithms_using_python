### Purpose:
<p>Concepts of Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List and possible operations with them.</p>
<br>

### 1. Singly Linked List concepts:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Read the concepts in the file which is usually named with suffix '_concepts' in each directory/sub_directory</li>
  <li>Work out in the order</li>
  <li>Singly Linked list has a head</li>
  <li>head is the entry point to a linked list</li>
  <li>Each element in Singly Linked list will have the location of the next element </li>
  <li>The last element will have 'None' as the next element (meaning end of the singly linked list)</li>
  <li>To be able to perform any manipulation or action in the Singly Linked List, we need to access its head first. or its last element depending upon the implementation</li>
</ul>
<br>

### 2. Implementation of the Singly Linked List:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Singly Linked List can be implemented in number of ways and all of them include creating an object (class)</li>
  <li>It includes creating an Object for Node which stores two variables; its data and the ' reference' to its next Node</li>
  <li>Secondaly it includes an Object for Singly Linked List which makes use of the Node object created above.</li>
</ul>
<br>

### 3. Doubly Linked List concepts:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of Simple linked list using 'Node'  classes</li>
  <li>Traversing a singly linked list and print each Node's value</li>
  <li>Create a singly linked list - Basic</li>
  <li>Create a single linked list  - Better</li>
  <li>Implement a DoublyNode and Doubly Linked List with append and to_list methods</li>
  <li>Prepend, Append, Insert, Size, Remove in Singly linked list</li>
  <li>Reverse a Singly linked list</li>
</ul>
