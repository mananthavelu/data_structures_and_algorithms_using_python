# First element is head
# Last element is Tail

""" 
Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue
Deque (Double ended queues): We can enqueue and dequeue from both the ends
Priority queue: When we insert an element in the queue; we assign the priority to each element and an element with highest priority is removed first
When more than one element shares the same priority; then the oldest element is removed first.
