### Tree Concepts
<ul>
  <li>Trees are non-linear data structure</li>
  <li>Tree has a 'root'</li>
  <li>The access to the Tree is using 'root'</li>
  <li>Tree must be connected - there is only one path between any two vertices in a tree</li>
  <li>Tree must be connected - there is only one path between any two vertices in a tree</li>
  <li>Tree is an un-directed graph</li>
  <li># Tree must not have cycles</li>
</ul>

# Terms: 
# Level: 'root' is at level 1 and the 'node' connected to it is at level 2 (Starts from top-> reaching bottom)
# Ancestor/Descendant ; Parent/Child
# Leaf: The nodes which dont have any child are leaf nodes or external nodes
# Leaf: The nodes which have the children are 'internal nodes'
# Height: The number of edges connecting two nodes from its bottom (starting at 0)
# Height: Height of the tree = Height of the root node
# Depth: Depth of the node is the total number of edges to its root
# Height and Depth moves inveresely


# Tree Traversal:

# DFS:  Priority to the nodes with childrens first
# Pre-Order Traversal: root, left, right
# In- Order Traversal: left, root, right
# Post - Order Traversal: left, right, root
# BFS: Priority to the nodes at the same level / Level order traversal; Root, second level, third level until we visited every single leafs
# Binary Trees: A Tree in which the nodes have in most two children including null 
# Search: O(n)
# Delete: If the node which is deleted; then the node below can be promoted provided it does not have any children
# Insert a Node to tree: We need to obey the two -children rule
# Perfect Tree: 3 nodes and 2 levels; 7 nodes and 3 levels; log(n)


# Binary Search Tree (BST):

# Unbalanaced Binary Search Tree:
