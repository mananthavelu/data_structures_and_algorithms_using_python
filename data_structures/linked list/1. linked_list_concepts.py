Singly Linked list concepts:
- Singly Linked list has a head
- head is the entry point to a linked list
- Each element in Singly Linked list will have the location of the next element
- The last element will have 'None' as the next element (meaning end of the singly linked list)
- To be able to perform any manipulation or action in the Singly Linked List, we need to access its head first
- or its last element depending upon the implementation

Implementation of the Singly Linked List:
- Singly Linked List can be implemented in number of ways and all of them include creating an object (class)
- It includes creating an Object for Node which stores two variables; its data and the ' reference' to its next Node
- Secondaly it includes an Object for Singly Linked List which makes use of the Node object created above.

Doubly Linked list concepts
Implementation of Simple linked list using 'Node'  classes
Traversing a singly linked list and print each Node's value
Create a singly linked list - Basic
Create a single linked list  - Better
Implement a DoublyNode and Doubly Linked List with append and to_list methods
Prepend, Append, Insert, Size, Remove in Singly linked list
Reverse a Singly linked list
