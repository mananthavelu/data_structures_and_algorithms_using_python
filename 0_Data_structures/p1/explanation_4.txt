The analogy is similar to explanation 2 (file recursion).

Given that a user may exist within the sub-groups; recursion is used to handle thia task.
As the children are stored in a list; a membership operation helps to search for a target user.


Time complexity: O(n*m): 

a. n: number of groups
b. m: number of users to look for


Space complexity:O(n+m)
a. n: number of groups
b. m: number of users to look for
