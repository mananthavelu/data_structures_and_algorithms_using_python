Steps taken:

1. The code is similar to the Trie implementation whereas it is intended to add(insert) the valid path as needed



Time and Space Complexity:

RouteTrie:

insertmethod: Time and space Complexity are both O(N) whereas N - is the number of parts in the URL.
find method: Time Complexity is O(N), Space Complexity is O(1)

RouteTrieNode:
Space Complexity and Time Complexity: O(1) given the dictionary implementation to be able to insert and retrieve in constant Time

Router:

add_handler method: Time and space Complexity are both : O(N)
look up method: Time Complexity is O(N) whereas the space Complexity is O(1)
