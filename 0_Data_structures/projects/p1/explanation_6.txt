# Union looks for all the elements which are in both Linked List 1 and 2. Linked list traversal along with membership check is a method which is used in solving both the problems.

Time complexity: Worst case/Average case/ Best case: In all the cases; traversal is need to check for the elements and its membership.

1.Union: O(n*m)
2. Intersection: O(n*m)

Space complexity: Worst case/Average case/ Best case:
1. Union: O(n+m)
2. Intersection: O(n+m)


n- length of an input to linked list 1
m- length of an input to linked list 2
