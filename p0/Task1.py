# Time complexity :O(m**2)

whereas;
n - total number of calls
m - total number of texts messages

Index based retrivals in an array is a constant time operation. However as we do this for all elements twice, in normal and worst case,
O(n*n) / O(m*m) will be needed.

if we consider the total number of texts > total number of calls; then the simplified version of time complexity is: O(m**2)

# Space complexity :O(1)

The final results are calculated directly and stored in a variable 'total_records_in_both_files'.
