a. Finding 'call_nos' requires O(n)

b. Once the 'call_nos' is constrcuted, then remaining set operations are constant time operations

c. Sorting needs O(nlogn)

So overall:

O(n + nlogn + constant operations)

Final and predominant time complexity: O(nlogn)

In the worst case, all the numbers which call could be telemarketers. Thus O(n)
